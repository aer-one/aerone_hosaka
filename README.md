# aerone's modified Soundmonster layout for crkbd

Retains the graphical layer indicator of Soundmonsters layout but the opposite side OLED is a static image, 32x128 px in a vertical orientation. The hex for the graphic is in the keymap.c file.

The key mapping is my own, loosely based on the default planck layout, retaining the tap hold space control configuration.

Per key RGB lighting is disabled but QMK underglow is enabled, flags are left in code for the user to change to per key if desired.
